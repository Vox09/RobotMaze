initial state:      left-up corner
transition model:   actually travel 
actions:            choose 4 directions
goal test:          right-down corner
                    arbitrary boundary
path cost:          rectangular grid each step is 1

stragety:           depth-first search 
  
  
log:  
1.Depth-first generation make the situation that there is only one way from one point to another.  
  
2.random open some walls from the original depth-first generated map to form a more complicated  map.  
  
3.greedy algorithm is no longer feasible in some cases.
  
4.greedy algorithm is always extend the top of the stack if possible, which makes a lot of repeated trials and waste time.
  
5.need to operate on the stack to implement A* or other more advanced algorithm  

6.g_limit algorithm: like greedy once dead not back.Fit into real robot but mat not be optimal.
  
TODO:  
1.add go back function and only display current place.
